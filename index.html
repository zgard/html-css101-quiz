                <p id="message">Many times, readers will get distracted by readable text when looking at the layout of a page. Instead of using filler text that says “Insert content here,” Lorem Ipsum uses a normal distribution of letters, making it resemble standard English.
                    This makes it easier for designers to focus on visual elements, as opposed to what the text on a page actually says.
                    Lorem Ipsum is absolutely necessary in most design cases, too. Web design projects like landing pages, website redesigns and so on only look as intended when they're fully-fleshed out with content. Even if the design work is gorgeous, its quality won't be apparent if all of the graphic elements are collapsed onto each other because there's no content in place to fill them out.
                    Lorem Ipsum can be especially helpful for projects that involve social media design, because it's virtually impossible to showcase a social media page layout without any content.</p>
